Track 3: Call Center Compliance 
1.You must design API that:
Accepts one MP3 audio file at a time via Base64 encoding.
Performs multi-stage AI analysis (Transcription → NLP Analysis → Metric Extraction).
Returns structured JSON containing compliance scores and categorized business intelligence.
Is protected using a mandatory API Key in the request header.

2. API Authentication
Requests without a valid API key must be rejected with a 401 Unauthorized status.
Header Format: x-api-key: YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY
3. API Request (cURL Example)
Endpoint Example: POST https://your-domain.com/api/call-analytics
cURL Request:

curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/call-analytics \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: sk_track3_987654321" \
  -d '{

6. Response Field Explanation
Field
Meaning
status
success or error
transcript
The full Speech-to-Text output (Hinglish/Tanglish)
summary
Concise AI-powered summary of the conversation
sop_validation
Object containing the greeting, identification, problemStatement, solutionOffering, closing, complianceScore (0.0 to 1.0) and dherenceStatus
analytics
Correct categorization of payment preference (EMI, FULL_PAYMENT, PARTIAL_PAYMENT, DOWN_PAYMENT) Correct identification of the reason if payment was not completed
Keywords
Detects the main keywords from the transcript and summary


7. Classification & Validation Rules
SOP Adherence: Must be measured against a standard script (Greeting → ID → Problem Statement → Solution → Closing).
Payment Categorization: Must strictly map to one of: EMI, FULL_PAYMENT, PARTIAL_PAYMENT, or DOWN_PAYMENT.
Rejection Analysis: If a sale is not closed, the AI must identify the reason (e.g., HIGH_INTEREST, BUDGET_CONSTRAINTS, ALREADY_PAID).
8. Evaluation Criteria
Participants will be evaluated on:
Transcription Accuracy: Quality of STT for Hinglish and Tanglish.
SOP Logic: Accuracy of the compliance score based on the transcript.
Data Categorization: Correctness of payment and rejection classification.
Vector Storage: Evidence that transcripts are indexed for semantic search.
API Performance: Latency of the AI pipeline and response reliability.

9. Rules & Constraints
❌ No Hard-coding: Results must be generated from the provided Base64 audio.
❌ Modified Audio: The Base64 string must be processed as-is.

10. Evaluation & Scoring Criteria
The evaluation will be performed by sending 10 predefined audio recordings to the participant’s API endpoint.
Each audio recording represents a test case that validates different aspects of the AI analysis pipeline such as transcription accuracy, SOP adherence detection, and business classification.
Each test case carries 10 points, for a total possible score of 100 points.
The evaluation is fully based on the API response structure and content correctness.

Test Case Scoring Structure
For every test case, the response returned from the API will be evaluated on the following components.
Component
Description
Points
API Availability
Endpoint responds successfully with HTTP 200 and valid JSON

Transcript Summary
Speech-to-text output correctly captures the main conversation content

Total per test case:
100 Points
Total across 10 test cases:
Converted to 90 points , 10 points for code quality and total 100 points 

SOP Validation Scoring Logic
Participants must analyze the transcript and determine if the call followed the required call center script.
The expected script structure:
Greeting → Identification → Problem Statement → Solution Discussion → Closing
The API response must include:
"sop_validation": {
"greeting": true,
 "identification": false,
 "problemStatement": true,
 "solutionOffering": true,
 "closing": true,
 "complianceScore": 0.0 - 1.0,
 "adherenceStatus": "FOLLOWED or NOT_FOLLOWED",
 "explanation": "Short explanation"
}
Evaluation criteria:
Condition
Result
Greeting and identification present
Partial compliance
Problem explained and solution offered
Higher compliance score
Proper closing statement present
Full compliance
Missing multiple stages
Low compliance


Payment Classification Rules
The API must classify the payment intent from the conversation.
Allowed categories:
EMI
FULL_PAYMENT
PARTIAL_PAYMENT
DOWN_PAYMENT
Example:
Customer says:
I can pay 2000 today and the rest next month
Expected classification:
PARTIAL_PAYMENT

Rejection Reason Identification
If the payment is not completed, the system must identify the most relevant reason.
Allowed categories:
HIGH_INTEREST
BUDGET_CONSTRAINTS
ALREADY_PAID
NOT_INTERESTED
NONE
Example:
Customer says:
I don't have enough money this month
Expected output:
BUDGET_CONSTRAINTS

API Response Format Requirement
Every successful API response must follow this structure:
{
 "status": "success",
 "language": "Tamil",
 "transcript": "...",
 "summary": "...",
"sop_validation": {
    "greeting": true,
    "identification": false,
    "problemStatement": true,
    "solutionOffering": true,
    "closing": true,
    "complianceScore": 0.0,
    "adherenceStatus": "NOT_FOLLOWED",
    "explanation": "The agent did not identify the customer. All other stages were present."
  },

 "analytics": {
   "paymentPreference": "PARTIAL_PAYMENT",
   "rejectionReason": "BUDGET_CONSTRAINTS",
   "sentiment": "Neutral"
 }
}
If the response structure deviates from this format, the test case will be marked as failed.

Failure Conditions
A test case will receive 0 points if any of the following occurs:
API does not respond


Response is not valid JSON


Required fields are missing


Classification values do not match allowed categories


Transcript is empty or missing



Summary
Evaluation will be conducted using 10 predefined audio test cases.
Each test case = 10 points
Total = 90 points
The system will verify:
API functionality


Speech transcription accuracy


SOP adherence detection


Payment intent classification


Rejection reason identification


The final score will be calculated based on the correctness of the API responses across all test cases.
